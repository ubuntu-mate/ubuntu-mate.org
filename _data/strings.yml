site_description: "
A community developed, Ubuntu based operating system that beautifully
integrates the MATE desktop.

Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with a configurable
desktop environment. Ideal for those who want the most out of their computers
and prefer a traditional desktop metaphor. With modest hardware requirements
it is suitable for modern workstations, single board computers and older
hardware alike."
