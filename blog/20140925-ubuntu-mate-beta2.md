Ubuntu MATE 14.10 Beta2 is now available for download. This second beta 
fixes a number of issues that were present in Beta1, adds a few new 
features and includes some more original artwork. We've managed to not 
introduce any new bugs this time but please **make sure you read the 
release notes below** because there are still unresolved issues you'll 
need to be aware of.

## What works?

Most things, more than in Beta1 at least. People tell us that Ubuntu
MATE is stable. You may, or may not, agree.

## What changed since Beta1?

Beta2 has been focused on fixing broken things and improving what was 
already present in Beta1.

## Upgrading from Beta1

Some of the meta packages have changed since Beta1. If you have Beta1 
installed, here is how to upgrade to Beta2.

Start a shell and update.

    sudo apt-get update
    
If you were tracking development packages between Beta1 and Beta2 you
will want to remove `grub-theme-ubuntu-mate` since it has a new name now.
    
    sudo apt-get remove grub-theme-ubuntu-mate
    
Complete the upgrade.    
    
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Remove some obsolete packages.

    sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-mate-desktop-policy-privileges
    
Remove an erroneous apt configuration that has existed since Alpha1.

    sudo rm /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00recommends

If you were tracking development packages between Beta1 and Beta2 you
may want to remove IBus.

    sudo apt-get purge ibus ibus-anthy ibus-gtk ibus-gtk3 ibus-qt4

Reboot, login, start a shell and clean up.

    sudo apt-get autoremove
    sudo apt-get autoclean
