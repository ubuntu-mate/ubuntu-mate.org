**Yeah baby! You know you want some of what we've got. Come and have a fling 
with Ubuntu MATE 18.04 Beta 2.**

We are preparing Ubuntu MATE 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) for distribution on
[April 26th, 2018](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseSchedule) With
this *Beta* pre-release, you can see what we are trying out in preparation for
our next (stable) version.

## What works?

People tell us that Ubuntu MATE is stable. You may, or may not, agree.

Ubuntu MATE *Beta Releases* are *NOT* recommended for:

  * Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues
  * Anyone who needs a stable system
  * Anyone uncomfortable running a possibly frequently broken system
  * Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable

Ubuntu MATE *Beta Releases* are recommended for:

  * Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs
  * Ubuntu MATE, MATE, and GTK+ developers

## What changed since the Ubuntu MATE 17.10 final release?

We've been refining Ubuntu MATE since the 17.10 release and making 
improvements to ensure that Ubuntu MATE offers what our users want today and 
what they'll need over the life of this LTS release. This is what's changed 
since 17.10.

### MATE Desktop 1.20

As [you may have seen, MATE Desktop 1.20 was released in February 2018](http://mate-desktop.org/blog/2018-02-07-mate-1-20-released/) and offers some significant improvements:

  * **MATE Desktop 1.20 supports HiDPI displays with dynamic detection and scaling.**
    * HiDPI hints for Qt applications are also pushed to the environment to improve cross toolkit integration.
    * Toggling HiDPI modes triggers dynamic resize and scale, no log out/in required.
  * Marco now supports **DRI3 and [Present](https://keithp.com/blogs/Present/)**, if available.
    * **Frame rates in games are significantly increased when using Marco.**
  * **Marco now supports drag to quadrant window tiling**, cursor keys can be used to navigate the Alt + Tab switcher and keyboard shortcuts to move windows to another monitor were added.

If your hardware/drivers support 
[DRI3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Infrastructure) then 
Marco compositing is now hardware accelerated. This dramatically improves 3D 
rendering performance, particularly in games. If your hardware doesn't support 
DRI3 then Marco will fallback to a software compositor.

You can [read the release 
announcement](http://mate-desktop.org/blog/2018-02-07-mate-1-20-released/) to 
discover everything that improved in MATE Desktop 1.20. It is a significant 
release that also includes a considerable number of bug fixes.

**Since 18.04 beta 1 upstream released MATE Desktop 1.20.1** and the 
following updates have recently landed in Ubuntu MATE:

  * `mate-control-center` 1.20.2
  * `marco` 1.20.1
  * `mate-desktop` 1.20.1
  * `atril` 1.20.1
  * `mate-power-manager` 1.20.1
  * `mate-panel` 1.20.1
  * `mate-settings-daemon` 1.20.1
  * `pluma` 1.20.1
  * `mate-applets` 1.20.1
  * `mate-calc` 1.20.1
  * `libmatekbd` 1.20.1
  * `caja` 1.20.1
  * `mate-sensors-applet` 1.20.1

These roll up a collection of fixes, many of which Ubuntu MATE was already 
carrying patch sets for. The **most notable change is that Marco 
is now fully HiDPI aware** and windows controls are scaled correctly.

### New and updated desktop layouts - *new since 18.04 beta 1*

I have decided to add a new layout to the collection available in Ubuntu MATE 
18.04. It will be called **Familiar** and is based on the Traditional layout 
with the menu-bar (Applications, Places, System) replaced by Brisk Menu. It 
looks like this:

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/familiar.jpg" alt="Familiar" /><br />
</div>

Familiar is now the the default layout, Traditional will continue to be 
shipped, unchanged, and will be available via MATE Tweak for those who prefer 
it.

**Since 18.04 beta 1 the Netbook layout has been updated**, maximised windows 
now maximise into the top panel like the Mutiny layout. Brisk Menu replaces 
the custom-menu and `mate-dock-applet` is used for application pinning and 
launching. When maximising a window this offers some decent space savings.

**Since 18.04 beta 1 the Mutiny layout has been tweaked** so the launcher icon 
is the same size of the docked application icons. We heard you, we understand. 
It's the little things, right?

### Global Menu and MATE HUD

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/layouts/global-menu.gif" alt="Ubuntu MATE Global Menu" /><br />
</div>

The Global Menu integration is much improved. When the Global Menu is added to 
a panel the **application menus are automatically removed from the application 
window** and only presented globally, no additional configuration (as was the 
case) is required. Likewise removing the Global Menu from a panel will restore 
menus to their application windows.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/layouts/mate-hud-local.gif" alt="Ubuntu MATE HUD" /><br />
</div>

The HUD now has a 250ms (default) timeout, holding `Alt` any longer won't 
trigger the HUD. This is consistent with how the HUD in Unity 7 works. We've 
fixed a number of issues reported by users of Ubuntu MATE 17.10 regarding the 
HUD swallowing key presses. The HUD is also HiDPI aware now.

### Ubuntu MATE Welcome - *new since 18.04 beta 1*

Welcome and Boutique have been given some love.

  * The software listings in the Boutique have been refreshed, with some applications being removed, many updated and some new additions. 
  * Welcome now has snappier animations and transitions

### Indicators by default

Ubuntu MATE 18.04 uses Indicators by default in all layouts. These will be 
familiar to anyone who has used Unity 7 and offer better accessibility support 
and ease of use over notification area applets. The volume in Indicator Sound 
can now be over driven, so it is consistent with the MATE sound preferences. 
Notification area applets are still supported as a fallback.

<img src="/gallery/layouts/indicators-small.png" alt="Ubuntu MATE HUD" /><br />
</div>

### MATE Dock Applet

[MATE Dock Applet](https://github.com/robint99/mate-dock-applet) is used in 
the Mutiny layout, but anyone can add it to a panel to create custom panel 
arrangements. The new version adds support for BAMF and icon scrolling.

  * MATE Dock Applet no longer uses its own method of matching icons to applications and instead uses BAMF. What this means for users is that from now on the applet will be a lot better at matching applications and windows to their dock icons.
  * Icon scrolling is useful when the dock has limited space on its panel and will prevent it from expanding over other applets. This addresses an issue reported by several users in Ubuntu MATE 17.10.

### Brisk Menu

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/brisk-menu-dash.png" alt="Brisk Menu Dash Launcher" /><br />
</div>

Many users commented that when using the Mutiny layout the *"traditional"* 
menu felt out of place. The [Solus Project](https://solus-project.com/), the 
maintainers of [Brisk Menu](https://github.com/solus-project/brisk-menu), have 
add a dash-style launcher at our request. Ubuntu MATE 18.04 includes a patched 
version of Brisk Menu that includes this new dash launcher. When MATE Tweak is 
used to enable the Mutiny or Cupertino layout, it now switches on the dash 
launcher which enables a full screen, searchable, application launcher. 
Similarly, switching to the other panel layouts restores the more traditional 
Brisk Menu.

**Since 18.04 beta 1 we tweaked the style of the session control buttons** in 
Brisk Menu and those updates will be wait for you are you install Ubuntu MATE 
18.04 Beta 2.

### MATE Window Applets

The Mutiny and Netbook layouts now integrate the 
[mate-window-applets](https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/mate-window-applets). You 
can see these in action alongside an updated Mutiny layout here:

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="LxJHgeF"><a href="//imgur.com/LxJHgeF">Mutiny undecorated maximised windows</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Minimal Installation

If you follow the Ubuntu news closely you may have heard that 18.04 now has a 
Minimal Install option. Ubuntu MATE was at the front of the queue to take 
advantage of this new feature.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/minimal-install.png" alt="Minimal Install" /><br />
</div>

The Minimal Install is a new option presented in the installer that will 
install just the MATE Desktop, its utilities, its themes and Firefox. All the 
other applications such as office suite, email client, video player, audio 
manager, etc. are not installed. If you're interested, here is [the complete 
list of software that will not be present on a minimal install of Ubuntu MATE 
18.04](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mate-dev/ubuntu-seeds/ubuntu-mate.bionic/view/head:/desktop.minimal-remove)

So, who's this aimed at? There are users who like to uninstall the software 
they do not need or want and build out their own desktop experience. So for 
those users, a minimal install is a great platform to build on. For those of 
you interested in creating "kiosk" style devices, such as home brew Steam 
machines or Kodi boxes, then a minimal install is another useful starting 
point.

### MATE Tweak

MATE Tweak can now toggle the HiDPI mode between auto detection, regular 
scaling and forced scaling. HiDPI mode changes are dynamically applied. MATE 
Tweak has a deeper understanding of Brisk Menu and Global Menu capabilities 
and manages them transparently while switching layouts. Switching layouts is 
far more reliable now too. We've removed the *Interface* section from MATE 
Tweak. Sadly all the features the Interface section tweaked have been dropped 
from GTK3 so are now redundant.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/mate-tweak.png" alt="MATE Tweak" /><br />
</div>

**We've added the following changes since 18.04 Beta 1**

  * Added support for the modifications to the Netbook layout.
  * Added a button to launch the Font preferences so users with HiDPI displays can fine tune their font DPI.
  * When saving a panel layout the Dock status will be saved too.

### Caja

We've landed [caja-eiciel](https://github.com/darkshram/mate-eiciel) and [caja-seahorse](https://github.com/darkshram/seahorse-caja).

  * **caja-eiciel** - An extension for Caja to edit access control lists (ACLs) and extended attributes (xattr)
  * **caja-seahorse** - An extension for Caja which allows encryption and decryption of OpenPGP files using GnuPG

### Artwork, Fonts & Emoji

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/emoji.png" alt="Emoji Picker" /><br />
</div>

We are no longer shipping `mate-backgrounds` by default. They have served us 
well, but are looking a little stale now. We have created a new selection of 
high quality wallpapers comprised of some abstract designs and high resolution 
photos from [unsplash.com](unsplash.com). The Ubuntu MATE Plymouth theme (boot 
logo) is now HiDPI aware. Our friends at [Ubuntu 
Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/) have uploaded a new version of Slick 
Greeter which now fades in smoothly, rather than the stuttering we saw in 
Ubuntu MATE 17.10. We've switched to Noto Sans for users of Japanese, Chinese 
and Korean fonts and glyphs. MATE Desktop 1.20 supports emoji input, so we've 
added a colour emoji font too.

**New since 18.04 beta 1 the xcursor themes have been replaced** with new 
cursors from MATE upstream, that also offer HiDPI support.

### Raspberry Pi images

We're planning on releasing **Ubuntu MATE images for the Raspberry Pi around 
the time 18.04.1 is released, which should be sometime in July**. It takes 
about a month to get the Raspberry Pi images built and tested and we simply 
don't have time to do this in time for the April release of 18.04.

## Known Issues

Here are the known issues.

### Ubuntu MATE

  * The *Desktop Layout* button in UBuntu MATE Welcome is extremely unreliable.
    * It is best to pretend you have seen that button and avoid clicking it. It will break your desktop, I promise.
  * Anyone upgrading from Ubuntu MATE 16.04 or newer may need to use MATE Tweak to reset the panel layout to one of the bundled layouts post upgrade.
    * Migrating panel layouts, particularly those without Indicator support, is hit and miss. Mostly miss.

### Ubuntu family issues

This is our known list of bugs that affects all flavours.

  * [Booting a live session is slow](https://pad.lv/1749546)
    * This will be fixed for final release.
  * [Post install I/O error after clicking "reboot now"](https://pad.lv/1760598)
    * To work around this reboot the computer. This bug is fixed, although not in the Beta 2 image, so the final release won't be affected.
  * [Ubiquity is uninstalling chosen locale language packs](https://pad.lv/1713702)
    * After a successful installation, your computer may not have all the appropriate language packs installed.
    * To work around this issue, open **Language Support** in the Control Centre and follow the prompts to automatically install the required language packs.
  * [Ubiquity slide shows are missing for OEM installs of Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Budgie](https://pad.lv/1713720)
    * To work around this, run `apt install oem-config-slideshow-ubuntu-mate` in the OEM prepare session.

You'll also want to check the Ubuntu MATE bug tracker to see what has
already been reported. These issues will be addressed in due course.
