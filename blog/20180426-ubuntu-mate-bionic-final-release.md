No one reads the release notes, isn't that right [Das
Geek](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIme1suHyN7cAGrTy8RBdhQ). So
when our friend [Stuart Langridge](https://www.kryogenix.org/) was
reviewing our draft release notes and commented that they didn't speak
to him, we thought *"all right, we can fix that"*. Stuart, since you
are such a special snowflake and no one else will read these notes,
here they are, bespoke release notes just for you!

# What changed since the Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS release?

Just about everything! Ubuntu MATE 18.04 is rammed to the rafters with
new features and improvements compared to 16.04.

## MATE Desktop 1.20.1

The MATE Desktop has transitioned from the GTK 2.24 based MATE 1.12 to
the very latest MATE 1.20.1 based on GTK 3.22. This migration has been
several years in the making, and most of 2016 and 2017 was spent refining the
GTK3 implementation. The move to GTK3 has made it possible to introduce
many of the new features you'll read about below.

Support for `libinput` has been added and is now the default input
handler for mouse and touchpad, which has resulted in much improved
responsiveness and support for multi-finger touch gestures.

Thanks to our friends at
[Hypra.fr](http://hypra.fr/-Home-17-.html?lang=en) accessibility
support (particularly for visually impaired users) has seen continued
development and improvement. MATE Desktop is proud to provide visually
impaired users the most accessible open source desktop environment.

### HiDPI

Since MATE Desktop 1.20 HiDPI displays are supported and provide
dynamic detection and scaling. HiDPI hints for Qt applications are also
pushed to the environment to improve cross toolkit integration. Every
aspect of the MATE Desktop, its themes, its applications, its icons,
its toolkit assets have been updated to enable

### The File Manager (Caja)

We've added some new features to the file manager (Caja).

  * Added **[Advanced bulk rename](https://tari.in/www/software/cajarename/)** - A batch renaming extension.
  * Added **[Encryption](https://github.com/darkshram/seahorse-caja)** - An extension which allows encryption and decryption of OpenPGP files using GnuPG
  * Added **[Hash checking](https://github.com/tristanheaven/gtkhash)** - An extension for computing and validating message digests or checksums.
  * Added **[Advanced ACL properties](https://github.com/darkshram/mate-eiciel)** - An extension to edit access control lists (ACLs) and extended attributes (xattr)
  * Updated **[Folder Color](http://foldercolor.tuxfamily.org/)** - An extension for applying custom colours and emblems to folders and files.
  * Replaced the deprecated `caja-gksu` with `caja-admin` which uses PolicyKit to elevate permissions in the file manager for adminstrative tasks.

`gksu` is deprecated and being removed from Debian. We are aligning
with that objective by replacing all use of `gksu` with PolicyKit.

### Window Manager (Marco)

If your hardware/drivers support
[DRI3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Infrastructure)
then the window manager (Marco) compositing is now hardware
accelerated. This dramatically improves 3D rendering performance,
particularly in games. If your hardware doesn't support DRI3 then Marco
will fall back to a software compositor.

Marco now supports drag to quadrant window tiling, cursor keys can be
used to navigate the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>switcher and keyboard
shortcuts to move windows to another monitor were added.

</div>

## Desktop layouts

Using MATE Tweak you can try out the various desktop layouts to find
one that suits you, and either stick with it or use it as a basis to
create your own custom desktop layout.

A new layout has been added to the collection for the Ubuntu 18.04
release Ubuntu MATE 18.04. It is called **Familiar** and is based on
the Traditional layout with the menu-bar (Applications, Places, System)
replaced by Brisk Menu. **Familiar is now the the default layout**.
Traditional will continue to be shipped, unchanged, and will be
available via MATE Tweak for those who prefer it.

Here are some screenshots of the desktop layouts included in Ubuntu MATE
to give you a feel for how you can configure your desktop experience.

  * **Traditional** Traditional - two panel layout featuring the iconic 'Applications, Places, System' menu

In order to create or improve the desktop layouts described above we've
spent the last two years working on a number of projects across the
MATE ecosystem that have enabled us to offer 8 different desktop
layouts, each providing a different desktop experience. Here's some
of the projects we worked on to make it all possible.

### Super key

<img class="right" src="/gallery/layouts/superkey-small.png" alt="Super Key">

Super key (also known as the Windows key) support is available in the
majority of the desktop layouts. This means <kbd>Super</kbd> can be used
to activate the menus/launchers, and other key-bindings that include
the <kbd>Super</kbd> key also continue to function correctly.

MATE Dock Applet, used in the Mutiny layout, also includes launching or
switching to docked items based on their position using in the dock
using <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>
which will be familiar to Unity 7 users. <kbd>Super</kbd> +
<kbd>L</kbd> is also recognised as a screen lock key-binding along with
the usual <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> that MATE
Desktop users expect.

### Global Menu

The Global Menu implementation has switched from TopMenu to
[Vala Panel Appmenu](https://github.com/rilian-la-te/vala-panel-appmenu)
which is **compatible with GTK, Qt, LibreOffice, Firefox/Thunderbird, Google
Chrome, Electron and others.**

Global Menus are integrated in the Mutiny and Cupertino desktop layouts
but can be added to any panel, for those who just prefer to use global
menus or those who want to maximise screen space available to their
applications.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/layouts/global-menu.gif" alt="Ubuntu MATE Global Menu" /><br />
</div>

### Indicators

<img class="right" src="/gallery/layouts/indicators-small.png" alt="Indicators" />

**Ubuntu MATE 18.04 now uses Indicators by default in all layouts.** If
you've used Ubuntu, these will be familiar. Indicators offer better
accessibility support and ease of use over notification area applets.
The volume in Indicator Sound can now be overdriven, so it is
consistent with the MATE sound preferences. Notification area applets
are still supported as a fallback.

We've been improving Indicator support from release to release for some
time now. In Ubuntu MATE 17.10 many of the panel layouts offered a
complete line up of Indicators, all of which are fully compatible with
MATE. The default Indicators are:

  * Optimus (*only available if you have nvidia prime capable hardware and drivers*)
  * Bluetooth
  * Network
  * Power
  * Messages
  * Sound
  * Session

### MATE Dock Applet

[MATE Dock Applet](https://github.com/robint99/mate-dock-applet) is
used in the Mutiny layout, but anyone can add it to a panel to create
custom panel arrangements. The new version adds support for BAMF and
icon scrolling.

  * MATE Dock Applet no longer uses its own method of matching icons to applications and instead uses BAMF. What this means for users is that from now on the applet will be a lot better at matching applications and windows to their dock icons.
  * Icon scrolling is useful when the dock has limited space on its panel and will prevent it from expanding over other applets. This addresses an issue reported by several users in Ubuntu MATE 17.10.

### Brisk Menu

[Brisk Menu](https://github.com/solus-project/brisk-menu) is an
efficient, searchable, menu for the MATE Desktop. We've collaborated
with the [Solus Project](https://solus-project.com/), the maintainers
of Brisk Menu. A number of features have been added so that, like
Ubuntu MATE itself, Brisk Menu is chameleonic. You'll find Brisk Menu
is used in several of the Ubuntu MATE desktop layouts and is presented
slightly differently in each.

The Mutiny and Cupertino desktop layouts make use of a new dash-style
launcher, which enables a fullscreen searchable application launcher
while the other layouts present Brisk Menu as a more traditional menu.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/brisk-menu-dash.png" alt="Brisk Menu Dash Launcher" /><br />
</div>

### MATE Window Applets

[MATE Window Applets](https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/mate-window-applets) make it
possible to add window controls (mazimise, minimise and close) to a
panel. We used Window Applets to enhance the Mutiny and Netbook layouts
so that both will now remove window controls from maximised windows and
relocate the window controls in the panel.

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="LxJHgeF"><a href="//imgur.com/LxJHgeF">Mutiny undecorated maximised windows</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Head-Up Display

A favourite of Unity 7 users is the Head-Up Display (HUD) which
provides a way to search for and run menu-bar commands without your
fingers ever leaving the keyboard. The HUD can be enabled via MATE
Tweak.

If you're trying to find that single filter in Gimp but can't remember
which filter category it fits into or if you can't recall if
preferences sits under File, Edit or Tools in your favourite browser,
you can just search for it rather than hunting through the menus.

The purpose of the HUD is to keep your fingers on the keyboard and
improve the efficiency in driving the menus for keyboard centric users.
We've locally integrated the HUD for similar reasons; if you're looking
at an application, why move the HUD to the top of screen away from where
your eyes are already focused? Keeping the HUD within the context of
the active application eliminates refocusing your attention to a
different part of the screen, particularly helpful for users with high
resolution or multi-display workstations.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/layouts/mate-hud-local.gif" alt="Ubuntu MATE HUD" /><br />
</div>

The HUD now has a 250ms (default) timeout, holding <kbd>Alt</kbd> any
longer won't trigger the HUD. This is consistent with how the HUD in
Unity 7 works. The HUD is also HiDPI aware now.

## Ubuntu MATE Welcome

Welcome and Boutique have been given some love.

  * The software listings in the Boutique have been refreshed, with some applications being removed, many updated and some new additions
  * Welcome now has snappier animations and transitions

### Browser Selection

A new Browser Selection screen has been added so you can quickly
install your preferred browser.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/browser-selection.png" alt="Browser Selection" /><br />
</div>

### System telemetry

Ubuntu MATE Welcome can submit anonymised system information, generated
during an install or upgrade, that will help the developers better
understand what devices Ubuntu MATE is being used on. This data will be
transmitted one time only and includes basic system components but
nothing that is uniquely identifiable. Here is [an example telemetry
report from the workstation of the Ubuntu MATE lead
developer](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/xWxbbDGBfn/). **We kindly request
that if you install Ubuntu MATE you participate in sending us a
telemetry report.**

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/telemetry.png" alt="Telemetry" /><br />
</div>

## Minimal Installation

The Minimal Install is a new option presented in the installer that
will install just the MATE Desktop, its utilities, its themes and
Firefox. All the other applications such as office suite, email client,
video player, audio manager, etc. are not installed. If you're
interested, here is [the complete list of software that is removed from
a full Ubuntu MATE 18.04 installation to make the minimal install](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mate-dev/ubuntu-seeds/ubuntu-mate.bionic/view/head:/desktop.minimal-remove).

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/minimal-install.png" alt="Minimal Install" /><br />
</div>

So, who's this aimed at? There are users who like to uninstall the
software they do not need or want to build out their own desktop
experience. So for those users, a minimal install is a great platform
to build on. For those of you interested in creating "kiosk" style
devices, such as homebrew Steam machines or Kodi boxes, then a minimal
install is another useful starting point.

## MATE Tweak

MATE Tweak can now toggle HiDPI mode between auto detection, regular
scaling and forced scaling. HiDPI mode changes are dynamically applied
and we've added a button to launch the Font preferences so users with
HiDPI displays can fine tune their font DPI.

MATE Tweak has a deep understanding of Brisk Menu and Global Menu
capabilities and manages them transparently while switching layouts.
Switching layouts is far more reliable now too. We've removed the
*Interface* section from MATE Tweak. Sadly all the features the
Interface section tweaked have been dropped from GTK3 making them
redundant. When saving a panel layout the Dock status will be saved too.

The Ubuntu MATE Guide is a comprehensive introduction to MATE Desktop and
Ubuntu MATE including **how to use everything we ship by default**, along with
detailed instruction on how to tailor, tweak and customise Ubuntu MATE to your
suit your preferences.

## Slick Greeter

Ubuntu MATE switched to [Slick
Greeter](https://github.com/linuxmint/slick-greeter) during the 17.10
development cycle, which still uses LightDM under the hood but is far
more attractive and HiDPI aware.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/layouts/slick-greeter.png" alt="Slick Greeter" /><br />
</div>

### Slick Greeter Settings

We worked with our friends at [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/) and
[Ubuntu Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/) to land a configuration
utility for Slick Greeter just moments before the final freeze window
closed for 18.04.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/lightdm-settings.png" alt="Slick Greeter Settings" /><br />
</div>

## Artwork

### Themes

The Ubuntu MATE themes have been uplifted from GTK2 to GTK3 including
the addition of a new dark variant of the Ambiant-MATE theme. We've
worked tirelessly on all the Ubuntu MATE themes making them fully
compatible with GTK 3.22 add ensuring every pixel is placed exactly
where it should be. [Michael Tunnel](http://michaeltunnell.com/) from
[TuxDigitial](http://tuxdigital.com/) retouched countless art assets
for the Ubuntu MATE themes including scaled variants for use on HiDPI
displays. The Ubuntu MATE icon theme was given a facelift thanks to our
friends at [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) and the default
mouse pointer cursors use the new upstream MATE theme which is also
HiDPI aware. Finally, blink and you'll miss it, the Ubuntu MATE
Plymouth theme (boot logo) is now HiDPI aware.

### Backgrounds

We are no longer shipping `mate-backgrounds` by default. They have
served us well, but are looking a little stale now. We have created a
new selection of high quality wallpapers comprised of some abstract
designs and high resolution photos from [unsplash.com](unsplash.com).

### Emoji

We've switched to Noto Sans for users of Japanese, Chinese and Korean
fonts and glyphs. MATE Desktop 1.20 supports emoji input, so we've
added a colour emoji font too.

<div align="center">
<img src="/gallery/bionic/emoji.png" alt="Emoji Picker" /><br />
</div>

## Major Applications

Accompanying **MATE Desktop 1.20.1** and **Linux 4.15** are **Firefox
59.0.2**, **VLC 3.0.1**, **LibreOffice 6.0.3.2** and **Thunderbird 52.7.0**.

</div>

See the [Ubuntu 18.04 Release
Notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes) for details of all
the changes and improvements that Ubuntu MATE benefits from..

## Raspberry Pi images

We're planning on releasing **Ubuntu MATE images for the Raspberry Pi around
the time 18.04.1 is released, which should be sometime in July**. It takes
about a month to get the Raspberry Pi images built and tested and we simply
didn't have time to do it in time for the April release of 18.04.

## Upgrading from Ubuntu MATE 16.04 or 17.10

  * Open the "Software & Updates" from the Control Center.
  * Select the 3rd Tab called "Updates".
  * Set the "Notify me of a new Ubuntu version" dropdown menu to "Long-term support versions".
  * Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> and type in `update-manager` into the command box.
  * Update Manager should open up and tell you: New distribution release '18.04' is available.
    * If not you can also use `/usr/lib/ubuntu-release-upgrader/check-new-release-gtk`
  * Click "Upgrade" and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Get the Ubuntu MATE snaps

When the upgrade is complete and you're logged in, open a terminal and execute:

    snap install ubuntu-mate-welcome --classic
    snap install software-boutique --classic
    snap install puilsemixer

The snap packages above are installed when performing a clean install of
Ubuntu MATE 18.04, but are not automatically installed when upgrading from an
earlier release.

## Known Issues

Here are the known issues.

### Ubuntu MATE

  * Anyone upgrading from Ubuntu MATE 16.04 or 17.10 may need to **use MATE Tweak to reset the panel layout to one of the bundled layouts post upgrade**.
    * Migrating panel layouts, particularly those without Indicator support, is hit and miss. Mostly miss.

### Ubuntu family issues

This is our known list of bugs that affects all flavours.

  * [Ubiquity is uninstalling chosen locale language packs](https://pad.lv/1713702)
    * After a successful installation, your computer may not have all the appropriate language packs installed.
    * To work around this issue, open **Language Support** in the Control Centre and follow the prompts to automatically install the required language packs.
  * [Ubiquity slide shows are missing for OEM installs of Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Budgie](https://pad.lv/1713720)
    * To work around this, run `apt install oem-config-slideshow-ubuntu-mate` in the OEM prepare session.

You'll also want to check the Ubuntu MATE bug tracker to see what has
already been reported. These issues will be addressed in due course.
