We are preparing Ubuntu MATE Xenial Xerus (16.04) for distribution on
[April 21st, 2016](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseSchedule)
With this *Final Beta* pre-release, you can see what we are trying out in
preparation for our next (stable) version.

> **Do Not Upgrade from 14.04!**
>
> There is an issue **affecting all Ubuntu flavours** that will
> cause an upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04 to fail, hard! See bug
> [#1555237](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-release-upgrader/+bug/1555237)
> for details. **Upgrades from 15.10 to 16.04 work just fine.**

## What works?

People tell us that Ubuntu MATE is stable. You may, or may not, agree.

Ubuntu MATE *Beta Releases* are *NOT* recommended for:

  * Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues
  * Anyone who needs a stable system
  * Anyone uncomfortable running a possibly frequently broken system
  * Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable

Ubuntu MATE *Beta Releases* are recommended for:

  * Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs
  * Ubuntu MATE, MATE, and GTK+ developers

## What changed since the Ubuntu MATE 16.04 Beta 1 release?

First of all, I'd like to extend my thanks to:

  * **[Luke Horwell](https://ubuntu-mate.community/users/lah7/)** and **[Robin Thompson](https://github.com/robint99)** for for their work on Ubuntu MATE Welcome and Software Boutique.
  * **[Gunnar Hjalmarsson](https://launchpad.net/~gunnarhj)** for his help making `im-config` and `gnome-language-selector` compatible with Ubuntu MATE.
  * **[Rico Tzschichholz](https://launchpad.net/~ricotz)** for his help completing MATE integration for Synapse.
  * **[Alexei Sorokin](https://build.opensuse.org/user/show/XRevan86)** and **Alberts MuktupƒÅvels** for their help improving MATE integration in Compiz.
  * **[Timo Jyrinki](https://launchpad.net/~timo-jyrinki)**, **[Daniel Holbach](https://launchpad.net/~dholbach)** and **[Artur Rona](https://launchpad.net/~ari-tczew)** for sponsoring package updates for Ubuntu MATE.

Also, thank you to everyone who has been testing Ubuntu MATE 16.04 Beta
1 and filing bug reports. It has really helped identify lots of little
issues that we've worked hard to fix.
