#### Yet more AI Generated wallpaper

My friend [Simon Butcher](https://twitter.com/simonjbutcher) üá¨üáß is Head of Research Platforms at Queen Mary University of London managing the Apocrita HPC cluster service. **Once again, Simon has created a stunning AI-generated ü§ñüß† wallpaper for Ubuntu MATE using bleeding edge diffusion models** üñå *The sample below is 1920x1080 but the version included in Ubuntu MATE 23.10 are 3840x2160*.

Here's what Simon has to say about the process of creating this new wallpaper for Mantic Minotaur:

> Since Minotaurs are imaginary creatures, interpretations tend to vary widely. I wanted to produce an image of a powerful creature in a graphic novel style, although not gruesome like many depictions. The latest open source Stable Diffusion XL base model was trained at a higher resolution and the difference in quality has been noticeable, particularly at better overall consistency and detail, while reducing anatomical irregularities in images. The image was produced locally using Linux and an NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU, starting from an initial text prompt and refined using img2img, inpainting and upscaling features.

## Major Applications

Accompanying **MATE Desktop 1.26.2** üßâ and **Linux 6.5** üêß are **Firefox 118** üî•ü¶ä,
**Celluloid 0.25** üé•, **Evolution 3.50** üìß, **LibreOffice 7.6.1** üìö
