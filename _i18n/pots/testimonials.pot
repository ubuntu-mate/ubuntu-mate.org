I will probably never leave Cinnamon and Plasma completely behind, but the incredible features that Ubuntu MATE has to offer make it so enticing that I find myself enjoying playing around with the system like a kid in a candy shop. Around every bend is a new incredible feature or design element that you can tell the team behind it put a lot of thought and effort into.\""

The team have continued to improve and adapt the desktop. Every time I think they must be running out of ideas, that does not seem to be the case.\"\n"

I didn't have any problems and every single piece of software I needed was available, so I think they did a really, really nice job.\"\n"
