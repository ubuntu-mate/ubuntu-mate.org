## Crowd Funding

Did you know one of the most important contributions you can make to Ubuntu MATE
doesn't require a single line of code? Like many open source projects, community
financial support not only helps keep the virtual lights on, but funds
improvements to Ubuntu MATE, the MATE Desktop, and numerous other Open
Source projects.

Between 2014 and 2017, your generosity helped pay for:

### Ubuntu MATE

* Welcome and Software Boutique
* Ambiant and Radiant Themes
* Brisk Menu
* Accessibility fixes and improvements

### MATE Desktop

* Reviewing and sponsoring uploads to Debian
* Development and packaging in Debian
* GTK3 migrating and porting
* MATE Menu
* MATE Dock
* [Engrampa](https://github.com/mate-desktop/engrampa)
* Development and packaging for Fedora and Linux Mint

### Open Source Projects

* [TLP](https://linrunner.de/en/tlp/tlp.html)
* [Geany](https://www.geany.org/)
* [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)
* [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
* [Tilda](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda)

* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
* [Open BSD](https://www.openbsd.org/)
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

## Spreading the Word

* MicroSD cards and memory sticks flashed with Ubuntu MATE to distribute at Raspberry Pi Jams
* Raspberry Pis, ODROIDs, and a secondhand iBook G4 for development of specific Ubuntu MATE images
* Dedicated servers
* Prizes for community competitors
* Getting Wimpy to UbuCon Europe 2016
* A reasonably-priced beverage to celebrate the release of 15.10 🍷

To show how a small donation can go a long way, let's look at how we funded
two Raspberry Pi 3's for development, costing £62.90 each. This breaks down to:

* 32 donations of £2, or
* 13 donations of £5, or
* 7 donations of £10 _(all with a little change to spare)_

In short, 😌 + 💵 💷 💶 💳 = 💚
