## Translations

Bonjour! Hola! Guten Tag! 你好！

If you speak another language, translating is a perfect way to help your fellow
speakers use the computer in a language more familiar to them. Contributions
even help the wider Ubuntu and Linux communities at large as applications are
shared between them.

### Ubuntu MATE

Applications specific to the Ubuntu MATE experience. For this website and our
in-house applications, we use Transifex.

{% include partials/app-directory.html list="ubuntu_mate" show="translations" %}

The **Welcome** application suffers from a 'split strings' issue that may
pose difficulties when translating in other languages. We apologise for the
inconvenience and intend to refactor the application in a future release to
address this issue.

Note that **Software Boutique** is currently part of the **Welcome** application.

> This website will soon be ready for translating! [Take a look at this post
for more information.](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/21386)
