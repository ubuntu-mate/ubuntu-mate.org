    - title: The Ubuntu MATE backstory
      era: "pre-2014"
      image:
      desc: >-

        Although Ubuntu MATE technically began with Martin Wimpress and Alan
        Pope's sitting around the latter's kitchen table, it first started years
        earlier, with Martin's quest to restore 'wedded bliss' to his home and
        his wife's desktop environment.

        At that time, Martin was an Arch developer (disclaimer: we were required
        to say that), and he and his wife were mostly happy using an "embryonic"
        GNOME 3. A few years after the birth of their first child, Martin's wife
        came back to a more fully fledged GNOME 3, and gave her husband a
        directive: make GNOME 2 come back.

        Martin knew the MATE Desktop, a continuation of GNOME 2, existed, but
        had never actually used it before. He installed MATE on the household
        computers and all was again well, but he noticed a few issues beneath
        the surface. Knowing a happy wife equaled a happy life, Martin did what
        any Linux-using husband would do: he began contributing to the MATE
        Desktop. At first, this was low-key, mostly packaging for Arch, but then
        he began to make patches and fixes upstream. He also began installing
        the MATE Desktop for family members who weren't as technically
        proficient, who mainly wanted ease of use and continuity.

        As Martin became more involved with the MATE Desktop, he also became
        more involved in the world of Linux podcasting. He became an occasional
        talking head on [Linux Unplugged](https://linuxunplugged.com/), which
        nicely dovetailed with his new role as a community manager for the MATE
        Desktop. This meant he started doing more interviews, one of which was
        on the [Ubuntu Podcast](https://ubuntupodcast.org/) in 2012 or 2013.
        During the interview Martin pointed out how MATE was rather broken in
        Ubuntu, which saddened Alan Pope, one of the shows' hosts, for anyone
        unfamiliar with the podcast. He's still there, along with Mark Johnson
        and...gasp!...Martin.

        A few weeks later, Martin got an e-mail from Alan with a one-word
        subject line: "Hah!" In the e-mail, Alan gave a link to matey.iso, the
        forebearer of Ubuntu MATE. By this point, Martin's family were growing
        frustrated with their desktop experience, and Martin found himself
        spending breaks managing their frustrations. They had stopped using the
        laptops Martin had provided, which were running the MATE Desktop on Arch
        (tricky to maintain from afar), and there were even rumors of switching
        to MacBooks. Quelle horreur!

        Alan's e-mail, therefore, couldn't have come at a better time. Martin
        knew Ubuntu's reliability would make "a sensible way forward." Alan and
        Martin took a day off work, and Martin made the brief drive to Alan's
        house. They sat in Alan's kitchen and put together the very first
        version of Ubuntu MATE. Once they were done, as Martin recalls, Alan
        "kind of looked at me square in the eye and said 'you're responsible for
        this now. I'm out.'"

    - title: "Ubuntu MATE becomes an official flavour"
      era: "15.04"

        Ubuntu MATE 14.10 was the [inaugural release]
        (https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-utopic-final-release/), and it
        didn't take long for wider adoption to follow. With the release of
        15.04, Ubuntu MATE was now an [official Ubuntu community flavour]
        (https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/02/ubuntu-mate-is-now-an-official-ubuntu-flavor).
        In 2015, [Entroware](https://www.entroware.com) announced it would offer
        Ubuntu MATE as a pre-install choice to its customers - the first example
        of an OEM supporting a boutique independent distribution. Incidentally,
        this made Martin's job as family IT support much easier, as he could
        simply point curious relatives to buy a laptop with the operating system
        he "basically designed for them pre-installed."

    - title: "Introducing Software Boutique"
      era: "15.10"

        The next release, however, involved a a news-making controversy: the
        removal of the Ubuntu Software Center as a default, in favor of a highly
        curated Software Boutique inside the new Ubuntu MATE Welcome. This
        sparked headlines across the Internet, even as many users admitted the
        Ubuntu Software Center was buggy and slow. The replacement, however,
        was popular with users - VERY popular with [Chris Fisher from JB]
        (/about/testimonials/).

    - title: "The First Official LTS"
      era: "16.04"

        Canonical granted LTS status to Ubuntu MATE 16.04, its first offical
        long-term support version. Canonical also upgraded Martin to an employee
        on the Desktop Team in time for the 16.10 release.

    - title: "Ending the PowerPC Era"
      era: "16.10"
      image:
      desc: >-

        Prior to 2006, Power PCs were popular in Macs, before Apple switched to
        Intel processors. Ubuntu MATE initially provided support for these older
        machines, even buying a few secondhand specifically for development and
        testing. However, supporting this older architecture became increasingly
        difficult, and 16.04.01 was the last build, with Long Term Support
        ending in April 2019.

    - title: "Ending the i386 Era"
      era: "18.10"
      image:
      desc: >-

        In a post to the [Ubuntu MATE community](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/ubuntu-mate-18-10-dropping-i386-images/16715), Martin explained that Ubuntu MATE would no longer provide i386
        (32-bit Intel) images, although they could continue to carry i386
        packages in the repository. Although this was an unpopular decision
        with users still running i386 architecture, this decision was in line
        with several application and driver vendors, including nvidia and
        Mozilla, who had previously dropped their own support for the older
        platform.

        The rest of Ubuntu MATE's history has yet to be written! The [roadmap](/faq/roadmap/)
        explains where the project will hopefully be in the years to come. If
        you want to be a part of that history to come, head over to our
        [Get Involved](/get-involved/) page.

        *Many thanks to InfinitelyGalactic for his interview with Martin, which
        provided much of the backstory and can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ls8xHhY4fI&t=1528s).*
