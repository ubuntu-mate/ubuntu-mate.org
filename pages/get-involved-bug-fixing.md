## Bug Fixing

If you're new to fixing bugs in Ubuntu MATE, and Ubuntu in general, you'll need
a [Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/+login) account. This
[Ubuntu Wiki page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HelpingWithBugs) is an excellent
place to learn about bug fixing in Ubuntu.

### Recommended Skills

Although programming knowledge is very helpful, there are some
non-programming ways to handle reported and triaged issues. For example, 
there might be a typo or a problem with documentation. If you're proficient 
in a non-English language, you might fix a translation error. If you have 
Internet detective skills, you can track down fixes from upstream developers 
or other distributions.

### Where to Start

The [Ubuntu MATE Bug Tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mate) lists all
open bugs. The bug tracker displays a bug's status (e.g. `New`, `Triaged`) and
its importance (`Undecided`, `Wishlist`, `Low`, `High`). If a bug is `New`, it's
best to [triage the bug](/get-involved/bug-triage/), to at least be sure it's a
confirmed bug.

If you would like to start in a safe bug-fixing sandbox, you can practice with
the trivial bugs of the [One Hundred Papercuts](https://launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts)
project.

### Learn More

This [Ubuntu Wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/HowToFix) page walks users 
through fixing bugs in Ubuntu. Also, be sure to join the amazing resource 
that is the [Ubuntu MATE community](https://ubuntu-mate.community/c/support/10)!

Lastly, this video explains why it's important to fix bugs in the right 
place, and why patching at the Ubuntu level (in the packages) is sometimes 
better than only fixing upstream.
