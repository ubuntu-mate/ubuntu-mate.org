# Roadmap

This page outlines some of the activities the Ubuntu MATE team will research,
and possibly implement, in future development cycles to improve and refine our
operating system.

{% include partials/toc.html %}

## Grow community participation and engagement

Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop are created by very small teams. We’ll improve our
documentation so that new contributors can find tasks they can work on and
material to help them get started.

## Reboot Ubuntu MATE Welcome and Software Boutique

We will decouple Ubuntu MATE Welcome and the Software Boutique so they can be
iterated on independently. The code for both will be refactored and simplified
so that other projects wanting to build on either can easily do so.

Both applications will be delivered as snaps to break the development cycle
relationship with the distribution, giving us the freedom to develop both
without the usual constraints of distribution release management. This will
also benefit Ubuntu MATE, which will automatically get new features, application
 listings, and other improvements.

## Developer tooling and collaboration

Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop will expand their use of continuous integration
and automated testing in an effort to save the small development teams burning
valuable time on activities best left to a bot.

Additionally, we will review the development platforms and communication/
collaboration tools used by the MATE Desktop team to improve team communication
and simplfy the project infrastructure where possible.

Lastly, we'll review the static site building tools using by Ubuntu MATE and
MATE Desktop so that the websites can be more easily maintained.

## Modern display server support

Wayland is set to become the defacto next generation display server. While Xorg
has some years of usefulness remaining, now is the time to start planning for
how MATE Desktop, and therefore Ubuntu MATE, implement support for Wayland.

## Voice command

Smart speakers are growing in popularity and commanding mobile devices by voice
is already common place. We will research how effectively voice commands can be
integrated into Ubuntu MATE.

## Accessibility

Making an accessible operating system was a key priority when the Ubuntu MATE
founders initially set out the goals of the project.

While Ubuntu MATE is never going to be able to offer the comprehensive
integration of assistive technologies that Sonar GNU/Linux provides, we will
continue to follow their lead so that Ubuntu MATE is a viable desktop solution
where computer access is shared within a household or business where individual
needs differ.

The upstream MATE Desktop team are actively engaged with visually impaired users
from the Linux community to ensure their needs are met. This effort will likely
never be complete, as it requires constant refinement.

## Translation

Translation of Ubuntu and MATE desktop is handled upstream thanks to the tireless
efforts of many translators, therefore the Ubuntu MATE operating system is
available in many languages. However, this website is currently available in
English only and we will work with the community to make it available in other
languages.
