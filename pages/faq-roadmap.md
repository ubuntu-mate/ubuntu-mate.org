# Roadmap 

This page outlines some of the activities the Ubuntu MATE team will research, and possibly implement, in future development cycles to improve and refine our operating system.

## Grow community participation and engagement

Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop are created by very small teams. Weâ€™ll improve our documentation so that new contributors can find tasks they can work on and material to help them get started.

## Reboot Ubuntu MATE Welcome and Software Boutique

We will decouple Ubuntu MATE Welcome and the Software Boutique so they can be iterated on independently. The code for both will be refactored and simplified so that other projects wanting to build on either can easily do so.

Both applications will be delivered as snaps to break the development cycle relationship with the distribution, giving us the freedom to develop both without the usual constraints of distribution release management. This will also benefit Ubuntu MATE, which will automatically get new features, application listings, and other improvements.

## Developer tooling and collaboration

Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop will expand their use of continuous integration and automated testing in an effort to save the small development teams burning valuable time on activities best left to a bot.

Additionally, we will review the development platforms and communication/collaboration tools used by the MATE Desktop team to improve team communication and simplfy the project infrastructure where possible.

Lastly, we'll review the static site building tools using by Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop so that the websites can be more easily maintained.

## Modern display server support

Wayland is set to become the defacto next generation display server. While Xorg has some years of usefulness remaining, now is the time to start planning for how MATE Desktop, and thefore Ubuntu MATE, implement support for Wayland.

## Voice command

Smart speakers are growing in popularity and commanding mobile devices by voice is already common place. We will research how effectively voice commands can be integrated into Ubuntu MATE.

## Accessibility

Making an accessible operating system was a key priority when the Ubuntu MATE founders initially set out the goals of the project.

While Ubuntu MATE is never going to be able to offer the comprehensive integration of assistive technologies that Sonar GNU/Linux provides, we will continue to follow their lead so that Ubuntu MATE is a viable desktop solution where computer access is shared within a household or business where individual needs differ.

The upstream MATE Desktop team are actively engaged with visually impaired users from the Linux community to ensure their needs are met. This effort will likely never be complete, as it requires constant refinement.

## Translation

Translation of Ubuntu and MATE desktop is handled upstream thanks to the tireless efforts of many translators, therefore the Ubuntu MATE operating system is available in many languages. However, this website is currently available in English only and we will work with the community to make it available in other languages.
