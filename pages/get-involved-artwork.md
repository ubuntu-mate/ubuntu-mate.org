We might be biased, or REALLY like the color green, but we think Ubuntu MATE is pretty sharp looking. If you're graphically inclined, or you love testing themes, then we have several different ways to contribute.

## Wallpaper

If you have digital art or photography you think would make a brilliant Ubuntu MATE wallpaper, we invite you to [share it with the rest of the community](https://ubuntu-mate.community/c/multimedia/artwork/8). To be considered for official inclusion in Ubuntu MATE, wallpaper must:

* have a minimum resolution of 1920x1080
* have a Creative Commons license stated in the post containing your wallpaper, e.g., "Licensed by CC-BY-SA"

## Theme Testing and Fixing

One of the best things about Ubuntu MATE, and all Linux distros, is the ability to customise your experience. Ubuntu MATE comes with the Ambiant-MATE theme as default, though users can choose from pre-installed themes or install their own. While most [GTK 2.x and GTK 3.x themes](https://mate-desktop.org/themes/) will work with MATE, some still need additional support to run smoothly. If you want to contribute in this area, you can:

* Test themes and ask them to support MATE
* Help fix issues with Ambiant-MATE and Radiant-MATE at [https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/ubuntu-mate-artwork](https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/ubuntu-mate-artwork)

## Develop Brand Artwork

Do you like swag? We do too! If you'd like to make [brand artwork](https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/brand-artwork), we'd love to see it. Before you start creating, keep these two things in mind:

* All brand artwork needs to be made available under the Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA-4.0)
* For usage of the Ubuntu MATE logo, please see the [guidelines](/get-involved/design-guidelines)
