## Artwork

We might be biased, or REALLY like the color green, but we think Ubuntu MATE is
pretty sharp looking. If you're graphically inclined, or you love testing
themes, then we have several different ways to contribute.


## Wallpaper

If you have digital art or photography you think would make a brilliant Ubuntu
MATE wallpaper, we invite you to
[share it with the rest of the community](https://ubuntu-mate.community/c/multimedia/artwork/8).
To be considered for official inclusion in Ubuntu MATE, wallpaper must:

* have a minimum resolution of 1920x1080.
* be posted under the [Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA-4.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) which must be stated in the post.


## Theme Testing and Fixing

One of the best things about Ubuntu MATE, and all Linux distros, is the ability
to customise your experience. Ubuntu MATE comes with the Ambiant-MATE theme as
default, though users can choose from pre-installed themes or install their own.

While most [GTK 2.x and GTK 3.x themes](https://mate-desktop.org/themes/) will
work with MATE, some require additional support to run smoothly. If you want
to contribute in this area, ask the theme maintainers to add MATE support or
submit improvements yourself.

If you've found a papercut in one of the pre-installed themes, raise an issue
or submit a pull request:

{% include partials/app-directory.html list="artwork" show="src" %}


## Develop Brand Artwork

Do you like swag? We do too! If you'd like to make brand artwork, we'd love to
see it. Before you start creating, keep these two things in mind:

* All brand artwork needs to be made available under the Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA-4.0) license.
* For usage of the Ubuntu MATE logo, please see the [Logo Guidelines](/get-involved/design-guidelines/).
