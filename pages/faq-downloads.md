# What should I download?

This page aims to address common questions for new users.

{% include partials/toc.html %}

## Which architecture?

* **amd64** is for a desktop or laptop computer built around 2005 and later.
While the name may suggest otherwise, this supports both AMD and Intel processors
capable of 64-bit instructions, BIOS and UEFI motherboards
as well as PC/Mac computers.

* **i386** has been discontinued and will no longer receive updates after April 2021.
This one runs on any 32-bit PC or Intel Mac.

* **armhf** is for the Raspberry Pi and other compatible microcomputers.
This one is 32-bit, but is recommended.

* **arm64** is the 64-bit version ideal for users that intend to run complex
applications that will benefit from a 64-bit instruction set.

**Historic**

* **powerpc** is for non-Intel Macs before 2006 and compatible IBM PowerPC
machines. New downloads for these are no longer available.

**Ubuntu MATE Exclusive**

* If you have an ultra mobile PC (UMPC), like certain GPD branded
  models or a Topjoy Falcon, we have builds designed specifically for that
  hardware.

  More details can be [found on our UMPC page](/ports/umpcs/).


## Which release?

* Choose an **LTS** (Long Term Release) if you prefer **stability**. These are supported for
**3 years** with a new upgrade available every **2 years**.

* Choose a **non-LTS** (interim) release if you like the **latest features**.
These are released more frequently (every 6 months) but are only supported for
9 months.

Both releases equally receive security updates provided by the Ubuntu team.
You may upgrade from an LTS to a non-LTS releases by changing your preferences in
the **Software & Updates** application.


## Which download method?

### BitTorrent

Instead of downloading from one source, BitTorrent retrieves and verifies the
file from many computers. This can help save bandwidth costs for the host, be
paused/resumed and in many cases achieve faster download speeds.

If you already have a BitTorrent client installed, a **magnet link** will
open it automatically.


### Direct Download

This is your standard download straight from the server to your browser (over
HTTP/S). It is [recommended to verify the download](/faq/verify-download-quick/)
using the provided checksum afterwards to be sure it was downloaded in one piece.


## Can I order a disc or USB drive?

Unfortunately, we do not have any suppliers to provide this service.
