## Community Support

If you are good with Ubuntu MATE and also good with people, then an unsung but vital form of contribution is helping your fellow users on our [Community](https://ubuntu-mate.community/) page. Here's some of the key ways you can help grow the community. 

### Help and Support Forum

Many Ubuntu MATE users, especially those who are new (and possibly new to Linux!) post in our [Support and Help Request](https://ubuntu-mate.community/c/support/10) forum. Helping others shares your knowledge with a wide audience, helps your fellow users achieve their goals, and helps the project reach more people. If you see a post where your experience and guidance could make a difference, be like Captain Picard and engage!

### Development Discussion

Even though [Development Discussion](https://ubuntu-mate.community/c/development-discussion/15) doesn't get as much lurve as Help and Support, it's still another forum that benefits from new viewpoints and voices. For example, one of our Hebrew-language users helped bring our attention to an issue where [Welcome struggled with right-to-left languages](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/some-rtl-issues-that-i-have-discovered-welcome-isnt-rtl-compliant/19585/8). This helped our developers fix the immediate issue, and to keep this in mind for future versions. So if you have an idea (that's not a bug report) on how to improve Ubuntu MATE, let us know in the Development Discussion!

### Be the Welcoming Committee

Patience is a virtue. And like most virtues, sometimes it isn't easy. Interacting online has its own challenges, and it can be a little too easy to dismiss people. But you could be the difference between someone who abandons Ubuntu MATE because of a lack of friendly support, and someone who becomes an invested member of the community. So be brilliant, be helpful, and as Bill and Ted say, be excellent to each other.
