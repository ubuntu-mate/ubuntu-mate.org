## Community Support

If you are good with Ubuntu MATE and also good with people, then an unsung but
vital form of contribution is helping your fellow users over at our
**[Community](https://ubuntu-mate.community/)**.
Here's some of the key ways you can help grow the community.

### Help and Support Forum

Many Ubuntu MATE users, especially those who are new (and possibly new to
Linux!) post in our [Support and Help Requests](https://ubuntu-mate.community/c/10)
category. Helping others shares your knowledge with a wide audience, helps your
fellow users achieve their goals, and helps the project reach more people.
If you see a post where your experience and guidance could make a difference,
be like Captain Picard and engage!

### Development Discussion

Even though [Development Discussion](https://ubuntu-mate.community/c/15)
doesn't get as much lurve as Help and Support, it's still another forum that
benefits from new viewpoints and voices. For example, one of our Hebrew-language
users helped bring our attention to an issue where
[Welcome struggled with right-to-left languages](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/19585/8).
This helped our developers fix the immediate issue, and to keep this in mind for
future versions. So if you have an idea (that's not a bug report) on how to
improve Ubuntu MATE, let us know in the Development Discussion!

### Tips, Tricks and Tutorials

If you think of something that would be genuinely useful to others, consider
writing out a guide, note it out as a quick tip, or write a tutorial. All posts
in these categories are wiki, so you are welcome to improve upon others'
work too.

### Be the Welcoming Committee

Patience is a virtue. And like most virtues, sometimes it isn't easy.
Interacting online has its own challenges, and it can be a little too easy to
dismiss people. But you could be the difference between someone who abandons
Ubuntu MATE because of a lack of friendly support, and someone who becomes an
invested member of the community. So be brilliant, be helpful, and as Bill and
Ted say, be excellent to each other.
