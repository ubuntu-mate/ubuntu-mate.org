<div class="alert alert-success"><strong>Success</strong> Many thanks for donating!</div>

We've spent a great deal of time creating Ubuntu MATE and it is great that you
have recognised the effort we've put into it. Donations will be put towards our
hosting costs and rewarding contributors to the project.

        promoting you to <b>Ubuntu MATE community super hero</b> status.</p>
