You can use your IRC web client to jump into our `#ubuntu-mate` channel on
[Freenode](https://freenode.net/).
Come and say hello! :wave:

If you need an IRC client, [**Hexchat**](https://hexchat.github.io/) is a popular
cross-platform client.

For support, you'll likely find your questions are best answered by
browsing and joining our [Community forum](https://ubuntu-mate.community/).
