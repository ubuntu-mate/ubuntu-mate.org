## Software Development

For programmers, developers and hackers alike, there are various projects to get
stuck into by contributing code and/or proposing solutions to problems.

Before submitting pull requests, be sure to have read its README, conform
to a project's guidelines and the license. Good starting points are looking
at issue lists to replicate problems, debug them and submit a patch that
fixes them.
