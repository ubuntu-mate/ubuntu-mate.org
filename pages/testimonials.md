      quote: "The Ubuntu MATE 19.10 distribution is an extraordinary distribution that combines tons of features that do not exist in its sister distributions. Offering various desktop workflows, good customization and old & new hardware support at the same time makes it indeed the best of what’s released this year."

      quote: "I keep thinking that Ubuntu MATE must run out of ideas at some point, yet they have surprised me on every single release. I look forward to seeing what they've come out with on the next release....On a final note, I do have to say to Mr. Martin Wimpress, you're making it difficult for me to justify staying with KDE when you're making Ubuntu MATE look this bloody good. Well-played, sir, well-played."
