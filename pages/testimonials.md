      quote: "I have really only started my journey with Ubuntu MATE, but I am definitely considering joining Team Green on more of my machines. I will probably never leave Cinnamon and Plasma completely behind, but the incredible features that Ubuntu MATE has to offer make it so enticing that I find myself enjoying playing around with the system like a kid in a candy shop. Around every bend is a new incredible feature or design element that you can tell the team behind it put a lot of thought and effort into."

      quote: "Ubuntu MATE has picked up where GNOME 2 left off, and it's a great desktop, and it's a great implementation of MATE... From what I can see, it's another high-quality release."

      quote: "In a way, this would be really good to see as Ubuntu's flagship desktop... Ubuntu MATE is quite something, and I'm not sure how much I'll be able to do it justice in this review... The team have continued to improve and adapt the desktop. Every time I think they must be running out of ideas, that does not seem to be the case."
