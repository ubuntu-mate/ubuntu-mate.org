      quote: "I have really only started my journey with Ubuntu MATE, but I am definitely considering joining Team Green on more of my machines. I will probably never leave Cinnamon and Plasma completely behind, but the incredible features that Ubuntu MATE has to offer make it so enticing that I find myself enjoying playing around with the system like a kid in a candy shop. Around every bend is a new incredible feature or design element that you can tell the team behind it put a lot of thought and effort into."

      quote: "In a way, this would be really good to see as Ubuntu's flagship desktop... Ubuntu MATE is quite something, and I'm not sure how much I'll be able to do it justice in this review... The team have continued to improve and adapt the desktop. Every time I think they must be running out of ideas, that does not seem to be the case."

      who: "OldTechBloke"
      quote: "Ubuntu MATE has picked up where GNOME 2 left off, and it's a great desktop, and it's a great implementation of MATE... From what I can see, it's another high-quality release."

      who: "Barbara Harris on Big Daddy Linux Live"
      quote: "Anybody who complains about the MATE green, on the Welcome screen you can just click a little thing to change the color, to go and customize it to the way you want it... once it's set you don't have to worry about it... I didn't have any problems and every single piece of software I needed was available, so I think they did a really, really nice job."
