## Spread the Word

We hope you love Ubuntu MATE as much as we do! If you do, we'd love for you to
share that excitement with others. Be creative! Put more green in your wardrobe.
When someone asks if you like coffee or tea, mention how you prefer MATE or
Ubuntu MATE. Here's a few other ideas.

### Social Media

This is definitely the easiest way to introduce your family, friends, and
random followers to Ubuntu MATE. Share a post from our [blog](/blog/). Follow
us at **[@ubuntumate](https://twitter.com/ubuntu_mate)**
and let our informative, GIF-filled posts inspire you to hit the 'Like' (and
maybe even the 'Retweet') button.

Talk about Ubuntu MATE on your favorite IRC,
Mastodon, and Telegram groups, or your favorite Linux forum. Post an
influencer-worthy pic of your home office on Instagram, and use a filter to make
that green login screen pop. Make a Tik-Tok video so we all become Internet-famous.

### Merchandise

Sometimes, spreading the word doesn't take any words at all! A stylish Ubuntu
MATE polo, T-shirt, or hoodie can tell your friends, family, and coworkers you're
 smart in your fashion AND Linux distro choices. Your morning cup of caffeine
 can get you through your day and help spark a conversation. Find all these
 goodies at our [shop](/shop/).

### Reviews

Finally, one of the most useful ways of introducing people to Ubuntu MATE are
through members of the Linux community who give helpful and honest reviews of
Ubuntu MATE's strengths and weaknesses. We're fortunate to have a strong
reviewing community, and you can see some of these reviews on our
[Testimonials](/about/testimonials/) page. Community feedback has always helped
us improve Ubuntu MATE, and we're excited to hear from new voices with new insights.
