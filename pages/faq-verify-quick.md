## What does this mean?

A checksum is a string of letters and numbers that is unique to a file, like a
fingerprint. Checksums are generated by different algorithms, with the two most
popular being **Secure Hash Algorithms (SHAs)** and the **MD5** algorithm.
Ubuntu MATE provides the **SHA256** checksum on its [download](/download/) page.

Verifying a download involves checking the checksum of the file you downloaded
*versus* the checksum provided on the download web site. Mismatching checksums
can indicate a corrupted or otherwise compromised file, so verifying your
downloads is a good habit to adopt!

## Windows

This method uses a third-party application named **MD5 & SHA Checksum Utility**.

* Download [MD5 & SHA Checksum Utility](https://raylin.wordpress.com/downloads/md5-sha-1-checksum-utility/)
* Launch the application *MD5_and_SHA_Checksum_Utility.exe*
* Click on the **Browse** button and browse to the *Ubuntu MATE* ISO file.

**Note:** To make calculation faster, it's only necessary to check the checksums
you have values for.


## macOS

On macOS, you can verify checksums easily and manually in the command line, as
`shasum` comes preinstalled.

* Open a **Terminal** window and a **Finder** window containing the ISO.
* Type `shasum -a 256` and drag the ISO's file icon into **Terminal**.

* Press **Enter** to begin the process. This may take a few moments.
* Compare the SHA256 checksum printed to the command line to the checksum on
the image's download page.

## GNU/Linux

#### GtkHash

This application can be installed via your distribution's software manager, if it is not already installed.

* Launch `gtkhash`
* In the **File** dropdown menu, select the ISO you wish to check
* On the page where you downloaded the ISO, copy the SHA256 checksum and paste into the **Check** field
* Click **Hash** - a green checkmark means the image is verified

#### Command Line

On every distribution, you have command line tools for verifying checksums.
In this case, we're interested in the `sha256sum` tool.

* First, switch to the directory where the ISO is stored
* Enter `sha256sum ubuntu-mate-XX.XX-version.iso`, substituting the name of the specific ISO you downloaded.
* Compare the SHA256 checksum printed to the command line to the checksum on the download page.


### Ubuntu MATE

On current Ubuntu MATE versions (18.04 LTS and newer), `caja-gtkhash` is
pre-installed and allows you to perform checksums from within the file browser.

* Navigate to the file in the Caja file manager.
* Right click the file and choose **Properties**.
* Open the **Digests** tab.
* Copy the SHA256SUM checksum from the download page and paste into **Check** field. The green check mark means the download is verified.
