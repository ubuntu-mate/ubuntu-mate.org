## Community Support

If you need help, we encourage you to join fellow users in the
[Ubuntu MATE Community](https://ubuntu-mate.community/). If this is your
first time, you'll need to create a new account using the **Sign Up**
button in the upper right hand corner. Once you have an account, post
your issue in [Support and Help Requests](https://ubuntu-mate.community/c/support/10). Be detailed with
your description of the problem and be excellent to each other.
