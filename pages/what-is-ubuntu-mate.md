If you are new to Ubuntu MATE, or only casually acquainted with Linux 
based distributions, it can be difficult to understand how a Linux 
operating system compares with other computer systems that you may 
already be familiar with. Hopefully this page with help demystify 
Ubuntu MATE for new-comers.

## Ubuntu

[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) is one of, if not the, largest deployed 
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) based desktop operating systems in the 
world. Linux is at the heart of Ubuntu and makes it possible to create 
secure, powerful and versatile operating systems, such as Ubuntu and 
[Android](http://www.android.com/). Android is now in the hands of 
billions of people around the world and it's also powered by Linux.

Ubuntu is available in a number of different *flavours*, each coming 
with its own desktop environment. Ubuntu MATE takes the Ubuntu base 
operating system and adds the [MATE Desktop](http://mate-desktop.org).

## MATE Desktop

Wikipedia says that [a Desktop Environment is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment):

  > an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of 
  programs running on top of a computer operating system, which share a 
  common graphical user interface (GUI). Desktop GUIs help the user to 
  easily access and edit files.

<img class="right" src="/assets/img/logos/mate-logo.png" alt="Ubuntu" width="112" height="112">

The MATE Desktop is one such implementation of a desktop environment 
and includes a file manager which can connect you to your local and 
networked files, a text editor, calculator, archive manager, image 
viewer, document viewer, system monitor and terminal. All of which are 
highly customisable and managed via a control centre.

MATE Desktop provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment 
using traditional metaphors, which means if you've ever used
[Microsoft Windows](http://www.microsoft.com) or [Apple Mac 
OS](http://www.apple.com), it will feel very familiar.

The MATE Desktop has a rich history and is the continuation of the 
GNOME2 desktop, which was the default desktop environment on many Linux 
and Unix operating systems for over a decade. This means that MATE 
Desktop is tried, tested and very reliable.

## Powerful Applications

While MATE Desktop provides the essential user interfaces to control 
and use a computer, Ubuntu MATE adds a collection of additional 
applications to turn your computer into a truly powerful workstation.

Naturally you'll also find a firewall, backup application, 
document/photo scanner and printer management all included in Ubuntu 
MATE. And this is just the start. The [Ubuntu Software Centre](http://apps.ubuntu.com)
includes thousands of applications suitable for just about any
professional or recreational pursuit.

## Games

In the last couple of years Linux has become a first class gaming
platform thanks to [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/) bringing the
[Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) platform to Linux. At the time
of writing Steam has more than 1000 high quality indie and AAA titles
available for Linux. Ubuntu MATE is fully compatible with Steam for
Linux.

While Steam is a major step forward for gaming on Linux, there are also 
many high quality and enjoyable Open Source games titles available 
for Ubuntu MATE via the Ubuntu Software Centre. It doesn't matter if 
you like flight simulators, motor racing, first person shooters, jump
and run or card games, you'll find something to keep you entertained.

## Open Source

<img class="right" src="/assets/img/logos/OSI-logo-300x352.png" alt="Open Source Initiative" width="112" height="131">

What Linux, Ubuntu and MATE Desktop all have in common is they are 
Open Source. Open source software is software that can be freely used, 
changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. In a 
nutshell Ubuntu MATE is free, in the truest sense of the word.

Although you will find some versions (distributions) of Linux for 
purchase, the vast majority are provided free of charge, like Ubuntu 
MATE. Open Source software is licensed in a way that allows anyone to 
give it away for free, no strings attached. For example, the licence 
gives any member of the user community the freedom to use Linux for any 
purpose, to distribute, modify, redistribute, or even sell the operating 
system. If you do modify and then redistribute Linux with your 
modifications, you are required by the licence to submit your 
modifications for possible inclusion into future versions. There is no 
guarantee that this will ever happen, but if you have made it better, 
then your changes just might be included in the next release of Ubuntu 
MATE.

This is how we can continually improve and grow without having to charge 
our users money. Many of the users of Linux are corporations that use 
the operating system to run their businesses, or include it within their 
products. Many of these corporations provide fixes and new features for 
Linux as they use the software for their businesses. These improvements 
are given back to the Linux distribution and the software improves as a 
result.

Unlike Windows, and OSX,  Linux is not created and supported by just one 
company. It is supported by Intel, Redhat, Linaro, Samsung, IBM, SUSE, 
Texas Instruments, Google, Canonical, Oracle, AMD, and Microsoft. Over 
4,000 developers contributed to Linux over the last 15 years.

Whether you are a home user of Ubuntu MATE, a Ubuntu MATE software or 
application developer, or an employee of an organisation that uses the 
operating system, you are a member of the Linux and Open Source 
communities and benefit from the efforts of the developers who contribute 
to Ubuntu MATE and its related projects, Linux, MATE, and Ubuntu. Members 
of the community can and do run Linux on almost any hardware, from the 
prettiest Macbook to the cheapest netbook, from the newest Chromebook to 
some very old machines designed for Windows, and from the most powerful 
Internet servers to the smallest smart thermostat.
