# In a nutshell...

Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with a configurable desktop
environment. It is ideal for those who want the most out of their computers and
prefer a traditional desktop metaphor. With modest hardware requirements it is
suitable for modern workstations, single board computers and older hardware alike.
Ubuntu MATE makes modern computers fast and old computers usable.

give you a feel for how you can configure your desktop experience.
