# In a nutshell...

Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with a configurable desktop
environment. It is ideal for those who want the most out of their computers and
prefer a traditional desktop metaphor. With modest hardware requirements it is
suitable for modern workstations, single board computers and older hardware alike.
Ubuntu MATE makes modern computers fast and old computers usable.


# Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the desktop layouts included in Ubuntu MATE to
give you a feel for how you can configure your desktop experience.
