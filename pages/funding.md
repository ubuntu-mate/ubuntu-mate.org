title: Funding

---

This crowd funding campaign has the following objectives:

  * Fund the costs associated with running the Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop projects.
    * These include domain name registrations and service charges for things like the content delivery network, web application firewall and transactional email services used by the forums.
  * Fund the development of Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop via financial rewards for contributors to either project.
  * Help subsidise the travel expenses of team members to represent Ubuntu MATE and MATE Desktop at FLOSS conferences.
  * Support other Open Source projects that Ubuntu MATE depends upon.

We have set up a number of payment options that should hopefully suit
everyone. Go on, be brilliant, help grow our community.

## Patreon

This is a unique way to fund an Open Source community. A regular
monthly income for the Ubuntu MATE project will allow us to better plan
how best to reward our contributors and sponsor other Open Source
projects.

**Patrons get exclusive project exclusive project news, updates, are invited
to join an exclusive Telegram channel where you can talk to the developers
directly and get a badge in the [Ubuntu MATE Community](https://ubuntu-mate.community).**

We'd prefer you set-up a recurring payment to help ensure that monthly
costs are always covered and it also allows us to better plan how to
reward our contributors and sponsor other Open Source projects.
That said, one time donations are also gratefully accepted.

**NOTE! If you are considering a monthly recurring payment via PayPal then
you should probably use the [Ubuntu MATE Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ubuntu_mate)
to benefit from Patron rewards.**
