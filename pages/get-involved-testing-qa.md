## Testing & Quality Assurance

Ubuntu MATE is always improving and changing. Our development team is constantly
working to make this the best experience possible but there will always be
**bugs**! Finding these makes life easier on the developers and makes things
better for our users. -- **including you** 😉

**So you want to find 🐛's and join in the fun? Yes, it really is!** 😊

* Join the [Ubuntu MATE Community](https://ubuntu-mate.community/)

* Create a [Launchpad/Ubuntu SSO](https://login.launchpad.net/qGtZ05jM0QUUftoV/+login) account

* [Download the ISO](http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker)

* Test!

* Report and Update the ISO Tracker

It's pretty simple but very important! Here are some tips & tricks that will help.

* [How to report bugs](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/how-to-report-problems-in-ubuntu-mate/17943)
* [Step-by-step guide](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Walkthrough)
* Let us know about issues via the [Ubuntu MATE Community](https://ubuntu-mate.community/)

Also remember to ask yourself **Is the problem reproducible?** We need to know
the steps needed to reproduce your issue.

While you can certainly download an ISO release individually. For convenience,
we **highly recommend** *zsync*. Eric Adams has produced a short video that is
a great introduction to using *zsync* for testing:

{% include blog/youtube.html
    embed = "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uZnAMefo0xs"
%}

We'd 💚 to have you join us in testing and become part of our **Community**.
We are always looking for more testers!

Finally, [Alan Pope](https://popey.com/) has produced a wonderful
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXLiqjOkSmg) on testing Ubuntu MATE.
We are sure you can do a better job of it than he did. 🤣
