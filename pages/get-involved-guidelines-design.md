## Design Guidelines

### Ubuntu MATE Logo
***

![Main Logo](/images/get-involved/logo-guidelines/Main_Logo.png)

The Ubuntu MATE logo captures the precise and reliable qualities of the brand in a straight forward symbol and wordmark.

It is made up of a custom designed font (wordmark), carefully spaced with a re-drawn ‘Circle of MATEs’ placed within a roundel.

Consistent use of the Ubuntu MATE logo is essential in creating a united brand identity. The master logo is supplied as artwork and should never be altered, distorted or re-created in any way.

### Logo Elements

### The Circle of MATEs

![Circle of MATEs](/images/get-involved/logo-guidelines/Circle_of_MATEs.png)

The Circle of MATEs is the symbol that accompanies the wordmark in the Ubuntu MATE logo. The triangles inside the roundel represent the three fundamental elements of this project: the Ubuntu base, the MATE Desktop and the community. The circular lines represent the connection and the collaboration between these elements.
