## Design Guidelines

### Ubuntu MATE Logo

{:.center}
![Main Logo](/images/get-involved/logo-guidelines/Main_Logo.png)

The Ubuntu MATE logo captures the precise and reliable qualities of the brand
in a straightforward symbol and wordmark.

It is made up of a custom designed font (wordmark), carefully spaced with a
re-drawn ‘Circle of MATEs’ placed within a roundel.

Consistent use of the Ubuntu MATE logo is essential in creating a united brand
identity. The master logo is supplied as artwork and should never be altered,
distorted or re-created in any way.


### Logo Elements

{:.center}
![Logo Elements](/images/get-involved/logo-guidelines/Logo_elements.png)

#### Wordmark

The logotype is created using the Ubuntu font. The word _MATE_ is uppercase and
represents the desktop environment used: MATE Desktop.

#### Roundel

Circular shape containing the Circle of MATEs.

### The Circle of MATEs

The Circle of MATEs is the symbol that accompanies the wordmark in the Ubuntu
MATE logo. The triangles inside the roundel represent the three fundamental
elements of this project: the Ubuntu base, the MATE Desktop and the community.
The circular lines represent the connection and the collaboration between
these elements.


### Available colorways
#### Wordmark

![Main Logo](/images/get-involved/logo-guidelines/Main_Logo.png) ![Main Logo White](/images/get-involved/logo-guidelines/Main_Logo_white.png)

The wordmark logo is presented only with colours above. Please, never change
any of the colours in the logo. The white logo has been placed on a green
background for visibility purposes. The background is not part of the logo;
you are free to place the logo on whatever background you want, so long as
you are able to see it.

### Roundel

As with the wordmark, use the roundel logo only with the colour configurations
above. The white version has been placed on a green background for visibility
purposes. The background is not part of the logo; you are free to place the
logo on whatever background you want, so long as you are able to see it.

### Which logo should I use?

It makes no difference which logo you choose to use for your works. There isn't
a _preferred_ version we like to see. Just select what you want so that the logo
is well distinguishable. We recommend that you use the white versions of the
logos on darker backgrounds, and that you use the coloured versions on lighter
backgrounds.

### Exclusion Zone

The Ubuntu logo must always have a clear area surrounding it, free from any
other element. To define this area, measure the height of the roundel and use
half this measure to create the boundary of clear space around the logo.

The Circle of MATEs, when used on its own, must always have a clear area
surrounding it, free from any other element. To define this area, measure the
height of the roundel and use a quarter of this measure to create the boundary
of clear space.

### Incorrect use

By following the guidelines on how to use this artwork, you will help to build a
powerful and united identity for the Ubuntu MATE brand. This section shows
examples of incorrect use.

You must not:

1. Change the spacing between the individual elements or characters
2. Change the colour of the wordmark
3. Change the colour of the Circle of MATEs
4. Change the arrangement of the elements
5. Place the logo at an angle other than horizontal or vertical
6. Change the proportion of the logo


### Ubuntu MATE stacked logo

A stacked version of the logo has also been made. Consistent use of the Ubuntu
MATE logo is essential in creating a united brand identity. The master logo is
supplied as artwork and should never be altered, distorted or re-created in
any way.

The stacked Ubuntu MATE logo must always have a clear area surrounding it, free
from any other element. To define this area, measure the height of the roundel
and use a quarter of this measure to create the boundary of clear space around
the logo.
