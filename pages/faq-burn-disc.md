## Burning to DVD

If your computer has a DVD burner and blank DVD-R/RW/+R/+RW media, here's how
you can make your own Ubuntu MATE installation disc and live session for your
desktop or laptop.

### Windows

Windows 7 (and later) supports the ability to burn straight from the desktop.
Right click the file and choose **Burn image**.

If you need to use an older computer running Windows Vista or earlier, consider
[InfraRecorder](http://infrarecorder.org/?page_id=5), a free and open-source
image-burning program.


### macOS

macOS supports the ability to burn using **Disk Utility**.
Right click the file and choose **Burn image**.

### GNU/Linux

Your distribution may or may not provide disc burning tools as many believe
it is an uncommon necessity these days. If you don't have one installed, here's
a couple you may try:

* [Brasero](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Brasero)
* [K3b](https://kde.org/applications/multimedia/org.kde.k3b)

Use your distribution's software manager to install these. Both are free and
open source software.

Right click the file and open the ISO file in the disc burning utility.
