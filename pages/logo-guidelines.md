# Ubuntu MATE Logo

<div align="center">
	![Ubuntu MATE Logo][logo]
</div>
The Ubuntu MATE logo captures the precise and reliable qualities of the brand in a straight forward symbol and wordmark.

It is made up of a custom designed font (wordmark), carefully spaced with a re-drawn ‘Circle of MATEs’ placed within a roundel.

Consistent use of the Ubuntu MATE logo is essential in creating a united brand identity. The master logo is supplied as artwork and should never be altered, distorted or re-created in any way.

# The Circle of MATEs
<div align="center">

</div>
<br>
The Circle of MATEs is the symbol that accompanies the wordmark in the Ubuntu MATE logo. The triangles inside the roundel represent the three foundamental elements of this project: the Ubuntu base, the MATE Desktop and the community. The circular lines represent the connection and the collaboration between these elements.

# Available colourways

## Wordmark

<div align="center">
	<img src="/gallery/Artwork/design-guide/Main_Logo.png" alt="Ubuntu MATE logo">
	<img src="/gallery/Artwork/design-guide/Main_Logo_white.png" alt="Ubuntu MATE logo white">
</div>
<div align="center" class="svg-download">
	<a href="https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/brand-artwork/blob/master/ubuntu-mate/Ubuntu-MATE-Tag-Green-and-Black.svg" target="_blank" style="width:422px"><span class="fa fa-download"> SVG</span></a>
	<a href="https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/brand-artwork/blob/master/ubuntu-mate/Ubuntu-MATE-Tag-White.svg" style="width:422px"><span class="fa fa-download"> SVG</span></a>
</div>
<br>
The wordmark logo is presented only with colours above. Please, never change any of the colours in the logo.
In this case, for the white logo, it has been placed a green background. It is not part of it, you are free to place the logo on whatever background you want, you just have to see it.

## Roundel

<div align="center">
	<img src="/gallery/Artwork/design-guide/Circle_of_MATEs_green.png" alt="Ubuntu MATE logo">
	<img src="/gallery/Artwork/design-guide/Circle_of_MATEs_white.png" alt="Ubuntu MATE logo white">
</div>
<div align="center" class="svg-download">
	<a href="https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/brand-artwork/blob/master/ubuntu-mate/Ubuntu-MATE-Rondel-Green.svg" target="_blank" style="width:216px"><span class="fa fa-download"> SVG</span></a>
	<a href="https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/brand-artwork/blob/master/ubuntu-mate/Ubuntu-MATE-Rondel-White.svg" style="width:216px"><span class="fa fa-download"> SVG</span></a>
</div>
<br>
As for the wordmark, use the roundel logo only with the colour configurations above. For the white version, it has been added a green background only to let you see it. It is not part of it.

# Which logo should I use?

It has no different which logo you choose to use for your works. There isn't a _preferred_ version we like to see. Just select what you want so that the logo is well distinguishable. We recommend to use the white versions of the logos on darker background, and to use the coloured versions on lighter background.

---

# Exclusion zone

The Ubuntu logo must always have a clear area surrounding it, free from any other element. To define this area, measure the height of the roundel and use half this measure to create the boundary of clear space around the logo.
<br>

<div align="center">
	<img src="/gallery/Artwork/design-guide/Ubuntu-MATE-Tag-Green-and-Black-margins.png">
</div>
<br>

The Circle of MATEs, when used on its own, must always have a clear area surrounding it, free from any other element. To define this area, measure the height of the roundel and use a quarter of this measure to create the boundary of clear space.

# Incorrect use

By following the guidelines on how to use them you will help to build a powerful and united identity for the Ubuntu MATE brand. This section shows examples of incorrect use.

You must not:

1. Change the spacing between the individual elements or characters

2. Change the colour of the wordmark

3. Change the colour of the Circle of Friends

4. Change the arrangement of the elements

5. Place the logo at an angle other than horizontal or vertical

6. Change the proportion of the logo

# Ubuntu MATE stacked logo

<div align="center">

	<img src="/gallery/Artwork/design-guide/Ubuntu-MATE-Tag-Green-and-Black-Square-margins.png">

	<a href="https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/brand-artwork/blob/master/ubuntu-mate/Ubuntu-MATE-Tag-Green-and-Black-Square.svg"><span class="fa fa-download"> SVG</span></a>
</div>
<br>

It has been made also a stacked version of the logo. Consistent use of the Ubuntu MATE logo is essential in creating a united brand identity. The master logo is supplied as artwork and should never be altered, distorted or re-created in any way.

The stacked Ubuntu MATE logo must always have a clear area surrounding it, free from any other element. To define this area, measure the height of the roundel and use a quarter of this measure to create the boundary of clear space around the logo.
