## What works?

People tell us that Ubuntu MATE is stable. You may, or may not, agree.

Ubuntu MATE *Beta Releases* are *NOT* recommended for:

  * Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues
  * Anyone who needs a stable system
  * Anyone uncomfortable running a possibly frequently broken system
